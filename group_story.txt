Eric's story
I woke up at the morning, I have breakfast and I studied until lunch time. 
After that I went for a walk for the whole afternoon. 
The night fell and I had to come back home in order to have dinner and get ready for the next day.

Mahdi's story
In the morning I overslept, and in the afternoon I woke up and caught up on some work.
At night, I went to the gym, and after dinner continued working on my assignments.
